Поэтому при входе на удалённый сервер неудивительно\nувидеть такую картину: \n[user@pc] # ssh server\nLast failed login: Sun Nov 15 16:12:10 MSK 2020 from 112.85.42.174 on ssh:notty\nThere were 13925 failed login attempts since the last successful login.\nLast login: Fri Nov 13 17:08:30 2020 from 123.33.12.100\n\nДалее мы настроим сервер так чтобы существенно усложнить жизнь злоумышленникам.\nНастройка минимально рекомендуемой конфигурации\nНесмотря на то что это минимально-рекомендуемая конфигурация, она отразит более 99% атак на SSH-сервер.\n# Запрещаем вход пользователю root через удалённый доступ\nPermitRootLogin no\n\n# Разрешаем подключение только для указанных пользователей\nAllowUsers user1 user2 user3\n\n# Меняем порт на нестандартный\nPort 14819\n\n# Запрещаем вход пользователям с пустыми паролями\nPermitEmptyPasswords no\n\n# Отключаем неиспользуемые способы аутентификации\nKerberosAuthentication no\nGSSAPIAuthentication no\n\n# Отключаем возможность доступа к графическим приложениям\nX11Forwarding no\n\n# Отключаем возможности туннелирования, использовать сервер в качестве промежуточного узла\nAllowAgentForwarding no\nAllowTcpForwarding no\nPermitTunnel no\nНастройка усиленной безопасности\nПомимо минимально рекомендуемых настроек, можно запретить доступ к порту сервиса и отключить вход по логину и паролю. \nБлокируем доступ к порту SSH для всех кроме доверенных IP\nНапример, с помощью firewalld:\nfirewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --remove-service=ssh\nfirewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-service=ssh\nfirewall-cmd --reload\nОтключаем доступ по логину и паролю\nНесмотря на то что аутентификация по ключам это более безопасный и удобный способ работы с удалёнными серверами, большинство \nинженеров предпочитаю работать с логинами и паролями.\nPasswordAuthentication no\n\nПосле этого потребуется создать ключ для пользователя:\nssh-keygen\n\nА затем скопировать его на удалённый сервер:\nssh-copy-id user@server\nПроверка и применение настроек\nПроверяем что настройки корректные:\nsshd -t\n\nЕсли приложение не сообщило об ошибках, значит всё хорошо.\nПерезапускаем службу:\nsystemctl restart sshd\n","id":"https://b.tinyops.ru/ssh-server-security-fundamentals/","title":"Настройка безопасности для SSH-сервера"},"https://b.tinyops.ru/syncthing-as-windows-service/":{"body":"Syncthing - это приложение для синхронизации каталогов между сетевыми устройствами.

Простыми словами — процессу было разрешено открыть максимум 100 файлов, а он попытался открыть 101-й.\nДалее — разберёмся как работает это ограничение в операционных системах Linux. Все пути будут указаны для CentOS\\RHEL-образных систем.\nОграничения ядра Linux\nПрежде всего ограничение на количество открытых файлов устанавливает ядро операционной системы. Посмотреть его можно\nвот так:\n[root@dracula ~]# sysctl fs.file-max\nfs.file-max = 3000000\n\nЭто суммарное значение на всю операционную систему. Чтобы посмотреть сколько сейчас открыто файлов достаточно \nпрочитать файл /proc/sys/fs/file-nr:\n$ cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr\n1154    133     3000000\n\n\n1154 — текущее значение открытых файлов.\n133 — сколько из открытых файлов не используются.\n3000000 — сколько разрешено открывать файлов.\n\nPAM\nPAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) — \nэто набор динамически-подключаемых библиотек для аутентификации пользователей.\nКонфигурация для PAM хранится в следующих каталогах и файлах:\n\n/etc/security/limits.conf\n/etc/security/limits.d\n/etc/pam.d\n\nФормат записи такой:\nnginx           soft   nofile 50000\nnginx           hard   nofile 50000\n\nСуществует два вида ограничений: soft (мягкий) и hard (жесткий). Soft-ограничения носят рекомендательный характер, \nв отличие от hard-ограничений. Процесс пользователя который превысил допустимое количество открытых файлов (nofile) по hard-ограничению\nне сможет открывать новые файлы, до тех пор пока не закроет как минимум один из ранее открытых.\nПроцесс, ядро и PAM\nВсе что описано выше показано на схеме:\n\nСтартует процесс, при каждой попытке открыть файл ядро операционной системы проверяет не исчерпан ли общий лимит. \nДалее — если процесс поддерживает PAM, делается вызов через библиотеку, не исчерпались ли лимиты.\nЕсли процесс не поддерживает PAM, какие бы лимиты ему не установили в конфигурационных файлах, он будет их игнорировать.\nОшибка «Too many open files»\nНапример, мы получили такую ошибку для nginx. Nginx поддерживает PAM, поэтому на него влияют настройки \nв /etc/security/limits.conf и упомянутых выше файлах.\nСмотрим сколько пользователю nginx разрешено:\n$ sudo -u nginx bash -c 'ulimit -n'\n\n1024\n\nВидимо что всего лишь 1024, для нагруженного сервера это может быть недостаточным. Добавляем в /etc/security/limits.conf строчки:\nnginx           soft   nofile 10000\nnginx           hard   nofile 10000\n\nТем самым разрешая лимит до 10000 файлов.\nВ старых ядрах Linux значение fs.file-max может быть равно 10000. Если требуется дать nginx больше 10000 файлов, \nто необходимо добавить в /etc/sysctl.conf значение с запасом:\nfs.file-max = 100000\n\nОперационная система перечитает пераметр при следующей загрузке. Чтобы не ждать ближайшей перезагрузки и \nприменить его «на лету», делаем вот так:\n$ sysctl -w fs.file-max=100000\n\nВ отличие от первого способа, эта настройка будет актуальна до первой перезагрузки операционной системы.\nПосле изменения настроек в конфигурации ядра и PAM необходимо перезапустить процесс nginx.\nПолезные ссылки\n\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/fs.txt - описание параметров ядра.\nСтатья про то как исправить ошибку «su: cannot open session: Permission denied».\n\n","id":"https://b.tinyops.ru/too-many-open-files/","title":"Ошибка «Too many open files» в Linux"},"https://b.tinyops.ru/transfer-data-with-croc/":{"body":"croc - это консольная утилита для удобной и безопасной передачи данных между двумя устройствами.\n\nОсновные возможности:\n\nПередача данных (файлы, текст) между устройствами (с использованием relay);\nEnd-to-end шифрование (авторы утилиты не смогут прочитать, то что вы передаёте);\nКросс-платформа (поддерживаются все популярные ОС);\nМожно передавать сразу несколько файлов;\nПоддержка докачки;\nНе нужно открывать порты и настраивать port-forwarding;\nС ориентиром на IPV6 и поддержкой IPV4;\nПоддержка работы через Proxy типа Tor.\n\nКак установить\nLinux\ncurl https://getcroc.schollz.com | bash\nMacOS\nbrew install croc\nWindows\nЕсли вы используете менеджер пакетов Chocolatey:\nchoco install croc\n\nЕсли вы используете менеджер пакетов Scoop:\nscoop install croc\nКак использовать\nНапример, нам нужно передать файл archive.zip с одного устройства на другое:\nИнициируем передачу на устройстве с которого отправляем файл:\ncroc send archive.zip\nSending 'archive.zip' (3.3 kB)\nCode is: sweden-light-jacket\nOn the other computer run\n\ncroc sweden-light-jacket\n\nУтилита сгенерировала секретное слово, которое мы должны использовать на принимающей стороне.

Например, вот так:\n[taxonomies]\ntags = [\"zola\"]\n\n\nПример отображения тэгов вы можете увидеть сразу под заголовком данной статьи.\nДругие статьи про Zola\nПо тэгу zola вы можете найти другие статьи из этого цикла.\n","id":"https://b.tinyops.ru/zola-tags/","title":"Как отобразить список тэгов в Zola"}},"docInfo":{"https://b.tinyops.ru/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://b.tinyops.ru/ddv-theme-for-zola/":{"body":27,"title":2},"https://b.tinyops.ru/everything/":{"body":30,"title":1},"https://b.tinyops.ru/fix-console-glitches-windows-10/":{"body":39,"title":3},"https://b.tinyops.ru/how-to-build-golang-with-dep-version/":{"body":28,"title":1},"https://b.tinyops.ru/how-to-fix-error-inaccessible-vm/":{"body":91,"title":4},"https://b.tinyops.ru/how-to-fix-no-tests-found-matching-method-issue/":{"body":24,"title":6},"https://b.tinyops.ru/how-to-fix-su-cannot-open-session/":{"body":161,"title":7},"https://b.tinyops.ru/how-to-upgrade-from-zabbix-4-to-zabbix-5/":{"body":155,"title":4},"https://b.tinyops.ru/linux-backup-with-borg/":{"body":146,"title":3},"https://b.tinyops.ru/nginx-websocket-proxy/":{"body":33,"title":2},"https://b.tinyops.ru/run-php-in-docker/":{"body":176,"title":2},"https://b.tinyops.ru/sftp-chroot-centos7/":{"body":79,"title":4},"https://b.tinyops.ru/ssh-server-security-fundamentals/":{"body":89,"title":1},"https://b.tinyops.ru/syncthing-as-windows-service/":{"body":37,"title":2},"https://b.tinyops.ru/tmux/":{"body":138,"title":1},"https://b.tinyops.ru/too-many-open-files/":{"body":102,"title":4},"https://b.tinyops.ru/transfer-data-with-croc/":{"body":73,"title":1},"https://b.tinyops.ru/yandex-screenshot-tool/":{"body":13,"title":0},"https://b.tinyops.ru/zola-intro/":{"body":59,"title":1},"https://b.tinyops.ru/zola-issues/":{"body":83,"title":1},"https://b.tinyops.ru/zola-set-theme/":{"body":41,"title":1},"https://b.tinyops.ru/zola-structure/":{"body":36,"title":1},"https://b.tinyops.ru/zola-tags/":{"body":34,"title":1}},"length":24},"lang":"English"};
